# Revamped Minecraft Generation

### Description
A 2D grid system that is divided into chunks and rendered asynchronously.

Players can zoom in and out and walk around in a theoretically infinite 2d world generated by perlin noise, similar to minecraft(but a bird's eye view).
Worlds can consist of different biomes such as deserts, forests and plains etc.

### Dependancies: 
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
- C++14 

### todo:
- movement
- zooming limits
- block/chunk objects
- animation
- use the camera instead of zooming?
- perlin noise generation (need a noise library)
- multithread the rendering
- make sure terrain is infinite
- entity/player objects
- then we can make a fullon game
